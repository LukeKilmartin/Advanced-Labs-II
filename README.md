# Advanced-Labs-II
This repository contains some data acquisition, visualisations &amp; analysis from my final year of physics labs in UCD.

Each of the 5 folders contains a README file, with a summary of what skills were involved, and some visualisations if applicable.

The MyModule.py python module was designed by me to streamline some of the more simple data analysis during my lab reports.  
So far it contains curve_fit (linear, quadratic), and Weighted Orthogonal Distance Regression (linear, quadratic, exponential).
